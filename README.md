# Reduced ARM ISA Core
This is a simplified design for a reduced ISA single cycle ARM core. This project is implemented using Verilog and a simulation tool called Logisim. In addition some of the verilog modules contain test bench modules for testing and verification of the working design.
## Why Was This Project Made?
This project was intially made for a Computer Architecture class using Logisim. The extension made for the project was an implementing the same chip simulated in logisism  using verilog. This involved transfering the design present in the simulation into RTL code to match the initial schematic.
## ISA Spec
The specification for the ISA can be viewed in the ULNAv2-B Instruction Format pdf.
